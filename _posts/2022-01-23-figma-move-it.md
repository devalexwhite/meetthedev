## Get move-it

You can download move-it from Github: [https://github.com/devalexwhite/move-it-plugin](https://github.com/devalexwhite/move-it-plugin).

For now, manual installation is required. Once you've downloaded the plugin, open Figma to any file. From the menu, got to `Plugins->Development->Import plugin from manifest...` and use the file browser to select the `manifest.json` file inside of the plugin folder.

## Usage

All of move-it's commands are available through the Quick Action bar. Press `CTRL+/` or `CMD+/` to open the bar. Type `move-it` to see and run the available commands. Commands operate on whatever is currently selected in the canvas!
